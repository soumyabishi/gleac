                  consent, such as when you authorize a third party application or website to

               <li>B. Complying with the Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing
                 Harm and Protection of our Rights. We may disclose your information,
                 including personal information, to courts, law enforcement or governmental
                 authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or
                 permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to
                 comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with legal process and to
                 respond to claims asserted against We , (iii) to respond to verified requests
                 relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or
                 any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal

                 the rights, property or personal safety, its employees, its affiliates, directors

                 injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of
                 fraud upon We and its Website and/or its Software applications. In instances
                 where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we
                 will attempt to notify that guest about the request after the fact where
                 appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer
                 prevented from doing so.</li>
